    <p>
      London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom,
      with a population of just over 9 million. It stands on the River Thames in
      south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the
      North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia. As one of
      the world's major global cities, London exerts a strong influence on its
      arts, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health
      care, media, science and technology, tourism, and transport and
      communications.
